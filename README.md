# Rainfall-Prediction
In this project there is an in-depth analysis of rainfall prediction for three distinct districts in Tamil Nadu, namely Erode, Dindigul, and Karur. Leveraging historical rainfall data, meteorological variables, and advanced machine learning techniques,and rigorously evaluated rainfall prediction models for each of these regions. The findings not only reveal the varying precipitation patterns in these districts but also demonstrate the effectiveness of the prediction models in capturing and forecasting these patterns. These insights hold great significance for agriculture, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about crop planning and irrigation strategies, and for local authorities to prepare and respond to potential flood or drought events. Ultimately, this study contributes to enhancing the resilience and sustainability of these agricultural communities in the face of climate variability.Intention of this project is to offer non-experts easy access to the techniques, approaches utilised in the sector of precipitation prediction and provide a comparative study among the various machine learning techniques.

Machine Learning Algorithms used:

* Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
* Random Forest Regressor
* XGBoost
* Exponential models
* ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
* K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  
Therefore, selecting the most suitable algorithm and customizing the model to the specific needs of the region or application is essential in ensuring reliable and effective rainfall predictions. This combination of advanced technology and local customization empowers nations to better manage their water resources, protect against the impacts of erratic rainfall, and support sustainable agricultural practices and water supply systems.
